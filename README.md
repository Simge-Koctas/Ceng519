- In order for benchmarking, 100, 104, 108, 112 and 116 number of nodes are used to calculate the key generation, encryption, decryption times, execution and compile times. 
- Simcount is taken as 100. 
- Result.xls file shows the results of key generation, encryption, decryption, execution and compile times depending on the generated output.
- Line graphs named KeyGeneration1**/Encryption1**/Decryption1**/Execution1**/Compile1** show the resultant graphs depending on the Results.xls.
- Graphs named Graph100/Graph104/Graph108/Graph112/Graph116 show the random network topologies of 100, 104, 106, 112 and 116 number of nodes.
